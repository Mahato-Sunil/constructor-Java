# constructor-Java
This is the program demonstrating the use of constructor in JAVA.
# Before Starting, what is constructor ?
In simple word, constructor are the methods which have same name as the class name. The constructor is mainly used to initialize the variable for a class. The constructor doesn't return any value. It doesn't even return void as, it returns the instances of the class itself.
# About Program 
* To understand the concept of constructor, lets look at the implementation of constructor.
In the program, a "Cuboid" class is created which has the members like length, breadth and height. 
* Similarly, a parameterized constructor is used to initialize the length, breadth and height of the cuboid. Here "this"keyword is used to assign the value to the mentioned variables. 
* Finally, a volume() method is created inside the class Cuboid to return the volume of the cuboid.
* In the main method, the constructor is called when the object of the class "Cuboid" is declared. It helps to make the code shorter and saves extra time. Instead of assigning the values to each of the variables of the class "Cuboid" using dot operator, we can initialize the values while creating an object.
* hence, constructor makes the code shorter and reduces the complexities.
